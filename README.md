# 100 Days of DataStructures and Algorithms

## Overview
Welcome! Here is my progress during the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Python will be the language adopted throughout the challenge, a priori. Changes will be recorded and updated.

Official Challenge Website [click here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)

## Two Main Rules

1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag

## Data Structures Basics

### Arrays

#### Overview

An array is a data structure that stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. It is characterized by its fixed size and random access to elements using indices.

#### Key Points

**Indexing:** Elements in an array are accessed using zero-based indices. For example, in a language like Python or JavaScript, ``myArray[0]`` refers to the first element.

**Fixed Size:** Arrays have a predetermined size that is defined at the time of creation. Adding or removing elements beyond this size may require creating a new array.

Common Operations:

- Access: O(1) - constant time.
- Search: O(n) - linear time, as it may require checking each element.
- Insertion/Deletion: O(n) - linear time, as it may involve shifting elements.

## Day 1: January, 15, 2024

**Today's Progress:**I solved the classic problem Two Sums. 

**Thoughts:** I adopted brute force for now. As I go advancing in studies on algorithm implementations, I think about some problems to try more optimized solutions.

## Day 2: January, 16, 2024

**Today's Progress:**I solved a little removing duplicatas in a array. 

**Thoughts:** I adopted in-place algorithm
