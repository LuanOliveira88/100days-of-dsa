<h1> 100 Days of DataStructures and Algorithms</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome! Here is my progress during the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Python will be the language adopted throughout the challenge, a priori. Changes will be recorded and updated.</p>
<h2>Two Main Rules</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.</li>
    <li>Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag</li>
</ol>

<h2>Data Structures Basics</h2>

<h3>Arrays</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>An array is a data structure that stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. It is characterized by its fixed size and random access to elements using indices.
</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>
<p><strong>Indexing:</strong> Elements in an array are accessed using zero-based indices. For example, in a language like Python or JavaScript, myArray[0] refers to the first element.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed Size:</strong> Arrays have a predetermined size that is defined at the time of creation. Adding or removing elements beyond this size may require creating a new array.</p>

<p>Common Operations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Access: O(1) - constant time.</li>
    <li>Search: O(n) - linear time, as it may require checking each element.</li>
    <li>Insertion/Deletion: O(n) - linear time, as it may involve shifting elements.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Day 1: January, 15, 2024</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Today's Progress:</strong>I solved the classic problem Two Sums. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Thoughts</strong>: I adopted brute strength for now. As I go advancing 
    in studies on algorithm implementations, I think about some problems to try more 
    optimized solutions.
